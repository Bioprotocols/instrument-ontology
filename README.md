(This is a stub repository currently, to provide a place to collect thinking and feedback about a `instrument-ontology`. See https://github.com/Bioprotocols/container-ontology for a model.)

It is unclear if the instrument-ontology is even desirable as a concept, and this repo may be deleted / made read only in the future. Please see the Discussions tab for further details and on-going discussions:
